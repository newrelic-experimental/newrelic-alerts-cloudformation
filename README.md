# newrelic-alerts-cloudformation
This repository provides an AWS CloudFormation Resource for creating or updating New Relic NRQL Alerts from a CloudFormation Stack.

This documentation assumes fluency in both NRQL Alerts and CloudFormation.

## Installation
- [Setup your environment for developing CloudFormation extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudformation-cli.html). At a minimum do this for Java as it's needed here.
- Ensure you have at least Java 8 installed
- Ensure you have the current version of Maven installed
- Clone this repository
- `cd` into the cloned repository directory
- Run `mvn clean package` 
- `cd` into `NrqlAlertCondition`
- To install the `NewRelic::Alerts::NrqlAlert` Resource into AWS as a privately registered extension run
  - `cfn submit --region <YOUR_REGION_HERE> --set-default`
  - You can validate the success of this operation by looking at the `CloudFormation > Registry: Activated extensions` console![](.images/Activated%20Extensions.png). Select the `Resource types` tab and set the drop down to `Privately registered`. If everything worked as it should you'll see the `NewRelic::Alerts::NrqlAlert` resource listed there.

At this point the Resource is ready for use in your Stacks.

## Usage
- See [create-alert.yaml](yaml/create-alert.yaml) for a sample of how to use the Resource.
- [The full schema for the Resource is here](NrqlAlertCondition/newrelic-alerts-nrqlalert.json).
- [The Alerts conditions API field names](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/rest-api-alerts/alerts-conditions-api-field-names/) is also helpful

### Trouble shooting
- If Stack creation fails first check the `CloudFormation > Stacks` console for your Stack. The `Status reason` column of the `Events` tab may have some helpful information.
- Next try the `CloudWatch > Log groups > newrelic-alerts-nrqlalert-logs` console ![](.images/CloudWatch%20Logs.png) for the current `Log events`. There you should find a detailed error message.
- Once in a while a bad Alert definition will not successfully roll back. When that happens go into the CloudWatch console, manually delete the Stack, and then `update-stack`.

## Developer Notes
- To install a new version of the Resource into CloudFormation
  - `mvn clean package`
  - `cfn submit --region <YOUR_REGION_HERE> --set-default`
- To test the Resource `create` or `update` the Stack
  - `aws cloudformation update-stack --region <YOUR_REGION_HERE> --template-body "file://yaml/create-alert.yaml" --stack-name <YOUR_COOL_STACK_NAME_HERE>`
